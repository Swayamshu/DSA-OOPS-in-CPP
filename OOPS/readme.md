## Why OOPS?
- Object oOriented Programming is principle of design and development of programs using modular approach.
- Traditional procedural programming focuses on processing of instructions in order to perform a desired computation, it emphasizes more on doing things like algorithms. Ex: C and Pascal.
- OOP combines both the data and functions that operate on that into a single unit called object. It follows bottom-up design technique, it is peicing together the smaller systes to give rise to more complex systems. Ex: C++, Java, Python, etc.

### C++ was created by adding classes in C -> to model real world problems.

It has various features that helps us write modular and scalable code for solving real-world propblems. 
1. **Encapsulation:** binding data members and functions into single unit (class).
2. **Abstraction:** only neccesary implementations are provided and other internal private implementation is kept hidden.
3. **Inheritance:** deriving new class from an old class.
4. **Polymorphism:** ability to take more than one forms.

### Class = Blueprint for an object

### const modifier
- data memebers of a const object cannot be changed after initialization.
- any change would result in **compile-time error**.
- const functions are not allowed to modify the object on which they are called.
